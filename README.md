I've created a fun "Red Light, Green Light" game ! The game is now saved as red-light-green-light.html in your project directory.

Here's what the game includes:

Game Features:
‚Ä¢ Visual traffic light that changes between red and green
‚Ä¢ Player character (üèÉ) that moves across the screen
‚Ä¢ Move button that only works during green light
‚Ä¢ Violation system - if you move during red light, you get pushed back
‚Ä¢ Statistics tracking (position, violations, time)
‚Ä¢ Win condition when you reach the finish line

How to Play:
1. Click "Start Game" to begin
2. Click "Move Forward" when the light is GREEN
3. Stop clicking when the light turns RED
4. If you move during red light, you'll be penalized and moved backward
5. Reach the finish line to win!

Game Mechanics:
‚Ä¢ Light changes randomly every 2-5 seconds
‚Ä¢ Each valid move advances you 15 pixels
‚Ä¢ Violations move you back 50 pixels
‚Ä¢ Timer tracks how long it takes to complete
‚Ä¢ Responsive design with smooth animations

To play the game, simply open the HTML file in your web browser:
